This is a guessing game that I came up with a friend for a boptcamp project, Basically you have to enter a random number and it will tell you if the number is to low or too high until 
you get the right number. All of your incorrect answers will be in the box on the bottom. I work on the   HTML, CSS part and I helped with some of the javascript coding part but my friend mostly did that part.
